# GoPlay

INTRODUCTION -->
“Go Play” is a mobile application interface to help connect people with the sporting activities they enjoy.  This project utlizes several geospatial technologies to create a ‘Mash-up’. 

THE PROBLEM -->
Open source base map applications (Google, BING, and Open Street Maps, etc.) do not provide users with detailed information about what infrastructure elements are located within park areas and often fail to correctly identify all park recreational area.

THE OBJECTIVE -->
Improved Mapping Capabilities, increased level of detail on open source maps, this mobile application is designed to unlock the details within park areas, and enable uses of the application to find sporting and leisure activity infrastructure quickly and with minimal effort in any park area on the globe.

METHODS -->
HTML, JQuery-Mobile, CSS3, and JavaScript, Google Maps API V3, and database development FIREBASE.  
The application has a four page framework.
Home page; links you to all other pages and also provides a link to the overall project summary
The second page is where the user can draw (using the Google Maps draw tool) a polygon on the map to identify sporting infrastructure.  After the user draws their polygon, it can be saved into a FIREBASE database.  
The next page is called the markers page, here, user drop a point on the map indicating what sporting infrastructure facilities they are using and provide some general information about themselves
The third page is called the all data page.  This page is all the data captured within the application combined and visualized together.  Polygon/KMZ data combined with cluster markers representing user activity.
